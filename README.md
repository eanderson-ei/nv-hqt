## Collaborating

To contribute to these scripts, fork this repo and clone it within a folder named `Scripts`, located in the root of a copy of the correct state's HQT Data Package.

```bash
git clone <url> Scripts
```

It's generally acceptable to work on the master branch for this project. See [this resource](https://eanderson-ei.github.io/ei-dev/git/collaborating-with-git/) for more information on submitting pull requests.

Make sure any files or folders created by your IDE are included in the `.gitignore` file before your first commit (e.g., `.vscode/`, `.idea/`).

Please update the `CHANGELOG.md` file with release notes following the practices documented [here](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). Include changes to the Data Package as well, as those changes must be replicated locally.

If you are changing code for one state, consider whether it is relevant to other states' codebase and make the changes there as well.

## Distribution

When packaging the Data Package for distribution following a new release or bug fix, the `.git`, `.gitignore`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` and `LICENSE` files may all be preserved. Consider deleting `.pyc` files and `__pycache__` folders and anything created by your IDE.

Make sure the `CHANGELOG.md` file is up to date, and clean it up if needed.

Importantly, do not confuse this version with the *official* version of the HQT! This version may contain unreleased changes. The official version is the version that was distributed by the program's administrator and is available on the program's website. If you are providing technical assistance or verifying a project assessment, make sure to use the appropriate version. Zipped copies of each official distribution are maintained on Sharepoint.
